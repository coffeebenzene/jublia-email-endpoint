# jublia-email-endpoint
Interview task - flask POST endpoint

Current plan:
  * Create database for emails
  * Create Flask app, allow writing to database (Use case: store email)
  * Create job function/script (Use case: execute sending of emails)
  * Create scheduler (most likely cron job?) (Use case: automatic sending of emails)

Note: Currently, everything is in python 3, mainly because I prefer it. I will try to make it as python 2&3 compatible as possible.
